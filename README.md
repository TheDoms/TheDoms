- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheDoms
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in IT and CyberSecurity
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all things IT related
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer virus, "Creeper," was created in 1971 as an experiment and simply displayed the message: "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" It didn't cause harm but instead led to the creation of the first "antivirus" program, called "Reaper." Itâ€™s incredible how cybersecurity started with a game of virtual tag!
